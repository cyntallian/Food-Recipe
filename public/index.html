          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Slice tofu into approximately 1/2 inch cubes and set aside. </li>
            <li>Prepare a wok or frying vessel with enough canola oil to submerge the tofu.  Heat oil to 370°F and add tofu in batches. Fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove tofu and set on a plate with a paper towel to drain.</li>
            <li>Prepare the sauce by combining seasoning, oyster sauce, and kalamansi juice. Whisk to combine. </li>
            <li>In a nonstick skillet melt the butter in a low hear. Once melted, over medium heat, saute onions for 1 minute, then add bellpeppers. </li>
            <li>Add tofu, then drizzle sauce and toss to make sure the sauce is evenly distributed over the tofu. </li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and add mayo, and mix well.</li>
            <li><b>To make sizzling:</b> Heat a small cast iron or enamel skillet to medium-high heat. Add 1 T of butter, which should melt quickly.  Immediately add the tofu sisig mixture.  Using a spoon, create a space in the center to add an egg. Remove from heat once you see the white of the egg beginning to form.  The residual heat will continue to cook the egg. </li>
            <li>Garnish with green onion, sesame seeds, and reserved thai chilis. </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Chef's Notes</h2>
          <p>This recipe can be modified depending on your preference or available cooking tools. The tofu can be air fried if you prefer it not to be oily. This recipe will taste just as good even without the mayo. The most important ingredients in this recipe are the knorr seasoning that adds flavor to the tofu itself. But if it is not available, you can use soy sauce instead.
